This project contains scripts for generating xdmf files usable by
ParaView, based on the output of 3D meep simulations or mpb calculations.

They are bash shell scripts which do a lot of unix stream editing
to turn templates into a complete (or at least workable) xdmf file.
They are not necessarily very elegant, but they work for me and may
be useful to others.

Meep:      http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Meep
XDMF:      http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Main_Page
ParaView:  http://www.paraview.org/

These scripts incorporate a fix for a data-format error in the files
MPB creates when using MPI -- see the mpb/README.
