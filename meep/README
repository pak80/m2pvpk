Here are scripts for generating an xdmf file that interprets a collection 
of meep-produced h5 fields (hdf5 files). At the moment the h5 files need
to be a particular set of files, a single file is not supported. See the 
scripts help for more information.

The result is readable/usable by Paraview.

The script is not very smart, but works fine if everything is set up for
it correctly.
