This ctl file runs a trivial meep simulation and stores data
that can be processed by m2pvpk_meep.bash

Note that neither of the P.name or P.xdmflist files here are
necessary, since they have values equal to the guessed and/or 
default ones used by m2pvpk_meep.bash - they are included here 
only as examples of what might be used.
